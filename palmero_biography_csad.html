      <h2>Childhood years</h2>
      <p class="yy">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup title="Childhood"><strong>1</strong></sup>Learning to ride a bike was a thrilling experience for a child. <sup>2</sup>Me, personally, have experienced ridiculous moments upon learning how to ride one.
        <sup>3</sup>Starting with one that has training wheels was the first step for me. <sup>4</sup>I was able to ride it comfortably within a short period of time. <sup>5</sup>After getting used to it, I decided to move forward with a bicycle alone. 
        <sup>6</sup>Hopping on it was easy, but staying still… not so much. <sup>7</sup>I got so wobbly to the point where my gathered friends had to support me side-by-side. 
        <sup>8</sup>Nervousness got less, but within just a few moments, my friends pushed and let go of me, making me wobble my way down a small steep hill at the end of our street. <sup>9</sup>In that very moment I was scared to death–holding my breath as if I was holding my soul. 
        <sup>10</sup>I didn’t want to fall and get hurt, and most importantly, I didn’t want to hit another soul near my path. <sup>11</sup>The moment I landed on the ground, I was still unstable, but I didn’t fall nor hit another soul–thank God. 
        <sup>12</sup>In fact, I held on much stronger and let the force from the steep ground push me forward, until I got the hang of it. <sup>13</sup>It was a quick thrilling moment for me, but right after that, I was able to ride a bicycle all on my own. <sup>14</sup>A core memory that shaped the kind of person I am. 
        <sup>15</sup>My parents named me <strong>Mary Christelle</strong>, because my birth day was relevant to Mama Mary, <u>December 08</u> - <i>Feast of Immaculate Concepcion</i>. <sup>16</sup>No matter how pretty it sounds, I still prefer to be called by my nicknames, <b><i>Mc or Maki</i></b>. 
        <sup>17</sup>My experience on learning how to ride a bike was significant, because then, I realized how scared yet adventurous my personality is. <sup>18</sup>I spent most of my childhood trying different activities, from different sports to different hobbies to different mini businesses. <sup>19</sup>I tried most of them with fear, yet my curiosity and hunger for experience kept me to the ground with my head held high. <sup>20</sup>Always aiming to the top, doing everything all at once to claim the highest prize among all. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup>But, little did I know, the knowledge I earn matters the most.</p> 

     <h2>Teenage years</h2>
      <p class="ty">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup title="Teenage"><strong>1</strong></sup>Stepping on my teenage years taught me the most emotional instances a person may encounter. 
        <sup>2</sup>I experienced my first innocent love, first heartbreak, drastic grief from the day my father died, and too much anger due to reckless reasons. 
        <sup>3</sup>Most moments are rooted from my will to experience. <sup>4</sup>The chaos started when I entered junior high. <sup>5</sup>I was 13yrs old, and most of the people surrounding me have already widened their social life. 
        <sup>6</sup>As an introvert, I didn’t care much at first. <sup>7</sup>All I was thinking was socializing drains me so much I’d rather sulk to death. <sup>8</sup>Not until I got too attached to another individual who shares the same hobbies and sentiments as me. 
        <sup>9</sup>I learnt how much I can offer to someone just for them to stay with me. <sup>10</sup>That’s when I felt pleasing other people matters a lot. <sup>11</sup>Thoughtfulness to them but not to myself. 
        <sup>12</sup>I strived on most aspects of my teenage life just to have that kind of prize–to be appreciated. <sup>13</sup>Later on, I suffered from selflessness, but I did not know that it affects my people worse than I thought. 
        <sup>14</sup>My thinking was shallow. <sup>15</sup>I often decide what's best for the people that care about me leading to a more shattered relationship. <sup>16</sup>Indecisive to my being, but decisive for others. 
        <sup>17</sup>I became a troubled kid that lies about where she’s going just to meet up with the people I crave love from, lies for the reason I asked for the money for, and all other things I feel embarrassed now. 
        <sup>18</sup>I also got to the point where I feel my anger higher than ever because of betrayals, abandonment, and not meeting expectations. <sup>19</sup>Regardless, my hunger to explore and to feel didn’t waver. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup>After everything, I still stood high, striving academically and personally, because that’s who I am.</p>
    
    <h2>College years</h2>
    <p class="cy">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup title="College"><strong>1</strong></sup>Before turning to college, I spent the 2 years of my senior year in a prestigious school, <strong>Pasig City Science High School</strong>. 
      <sup>2</sup>I must say, I was trained well. <sup>3</sup>There was no day that I felt chill because of how demanding that school is when it comes to student’s performance. <sup>4</sup>Break times were used to prepare for the next class because there can be a surprise quiz or graded recitation. 
      <sup>5</sup>The moment I turned college, some things were new to me, especially the system. <sup>6</sup>Fast paced school calendar, longer breaks, shorter discussions, and greater pressure. <sup>7</sup>To me, college is a brick that is wrapped with cotton foams, imitating a pillow. 
      <sup>8</sup>Seems easy to acquire, but in reality it requires great effort to have and carry. <sup>9</sup>I’m unsure if other universities are also like that, but it is here in University of The East. <sup>10</sup>My first year turned out to be lighter than I expected, that’s why I decided to join an extracurricular that offers scholarships once I stayed long enough. 
      <sup>11</sup>However, I wasn’t able to stay for long because of how conflicted my schedule became after getting to my 2nd year. <sup>12</sup>I even got to the point where I almost failed my Calculus class because of how determined I was on getting a scholarship. <sup>13</sup>In the end, I removed my membership and focused on academics instead. 
      <sup>14</sup>Luckily, I was able to maintain my overall grade for the sem to keep my Pasig scholarship. <sup>15</sup>There may be regrets from joining that organization, but the experience, development, and connections I established remain significant to me, that’s why I’m still grateful for committing. <sup>16</sup>Now that I have more time for academics, pressure arises more. 
      <sup>17</sup>Not seeing it as a danger coming at me, but an opportunity to do better and prepare myself for the near future of choosing a specific career. <sup>18</sup>I’m at the point of life where I feel immune to the emotion when things do not work out, living to the phrase <i>‘It is what it is.’</i> <sup>19</sup>Telling myself that my life does not revolve for one aspect at a time, but simultaneously with others. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup>I can finally say that I don’t live solely for others anymore, because all this time, <em>the appreciation that I really need the most  is from myself.</em></p>
